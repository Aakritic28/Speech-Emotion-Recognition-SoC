## Week 3

Hello friends, Let's start with week 3, where we will learn about Neural Networks.

#TASK 

 You have to implement a basic Neural Network model from scratch and an RNN model using a library.
 You also have to answer the short answer type Questions given in the RNNques.pdf and upload the answer pdf in the Google form link given below.

 ## Neural Network
 The below video tutorial consists of both the concept explanation and practical application (coding part) of NN on MNIST dataset.
 You have to watch only till the 7th video of the playlist. (8th video is on deep neural network, which is not our focus for this week)
