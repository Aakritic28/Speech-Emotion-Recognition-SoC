## Speech-Emotion-Recognition-SoC
## Week 5 & 6

Bonjour les amis, Now it's time for the project, all the resources and dataset links are available in the project.ipynb file itself. You guys have to use the ML knowledge you have gained in the past month.

## Week 7 & 8
These two weeks are a fun activity for you guys, where you will make your own tictactoe AI bot. It will also give you an introduction to AI and Game theory.
You have to go through the study material AI.pdf and the question is given in Tictactoe_Ques.pdf. You have to modify only the q1.py file and execute 7 functions
(is_win(self), is_draw(self), get_valid_actions(self), is_terminal_history(self), get_utility_given_terminal_history(self), update_history(self, action), backward_induction(history_obj)) according to the comments given after their initialization.
I hope you will really enjoy this activity and if you execute properly then you will see that your bot will never lose no matter what techniques you use.
