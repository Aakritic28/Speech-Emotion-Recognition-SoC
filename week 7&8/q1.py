    # (2a)These are dictionary with keys as string representation of the history list e.g. if the history list of the
    # history_obj is [0, 4, 2, 5], then the key is "0425". Each value is in turn a dictionary with keys as actions 0-8

    # choosing that action). Example: {”0452”: {”0”: 0, ”1”: 0, ”2”: 0, ”3”: 0, ”4”: 0, ”5”: 0, ”6”: 1, ”7”: 0, ”8”:

    # (2b) Note, the strategy for each history in strategy_dict_x and strategy_dict_o is probability distribution over
    # actions. But since tictactoe is a PIEFG, there always exists an optimal deterministic strategy (SPNE). So your
    # policy will be something like this {"0": 1, "1": 0, "2": 0, "3": 0, "4": 0, "5": 0, "6": 0, "7": 0, "8": 0} where
